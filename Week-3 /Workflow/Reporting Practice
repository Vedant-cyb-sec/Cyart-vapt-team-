Reporting Practice Workflow
##Step 1 – Evidence Collection

Screenshots of successful exploitation were captured.

Proof of vulnerabilities was organized vulnerability-wise.

##Step 2 – Report Structuring

A VAPT report template was created in Google Docs.

Major sections were defined:

Executive Summary

Technical Findings

Remediation Plan

Findings Table

##Step 3 – Findings Documentation

Each vulnerability was documented with:

Description

Impact

CVSS score

Proof screenshots

Recommended remediation

##Step 4 – Findings Logging

All identified vulnerabilities were logged into a centralized findings table.

Severity levels were assigned based on CVSS scores.

##Step 5 – Visualization

Network attack path diagrams were created using Draw.io.

Attack flows were mapped visually for better understanding.

##Step 6 – Management Brief Preparation

A non-technical summary was drafted for management stakeholders.

Technical details were simplified into business-impact language.

##Step 7 – Final Review & Export

The complete report was reviewed for clarity and accuracy.

Final documentation was exported to PDF for submission.
