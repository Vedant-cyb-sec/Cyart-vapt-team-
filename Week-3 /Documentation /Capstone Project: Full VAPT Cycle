Capstone Project: Full VAPT Cycle

A full vulnerability assessment and penetration testing cycle was performed on a vulnerable VulnHub virtual machine in a controlled lab environment. 
OpenVAS was used to identify vulnerabilities and Metasploit was used for exploitation simulation. 
Findings were documented, remediation was suggested, and rescanning was performed to verify fixes.
