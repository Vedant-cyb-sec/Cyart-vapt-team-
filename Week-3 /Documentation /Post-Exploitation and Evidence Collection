Post-Exploitation and Evidence Collection

Controlled post-exploitation activities were performed on a vulnerable lab virtual machine to study privilege escalation risks and forensic evidence handling. 
Network traffic was captured using Wireshark, and digital artifacts were hashed with SHA-256 to preserve integrity. 
All evidence was documented with proper chain-of-custody records to ensure accountability and forensic validity.
