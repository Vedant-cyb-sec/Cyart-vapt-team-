##PoC Customization Summary 
A public proof-of-concept script was modified to work strictly inside the authorized lab environment.
Hard-coded values were replaced with configurable parameters, logging was added for result verification, and safety checks were implemented to prevent execution outside the test scope. 
This ensured controlled testing while preserving the original vulnerability validation logic.
