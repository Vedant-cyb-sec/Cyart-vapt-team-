# Exploitation & Post-Exploitation Lab – Week 3

Target: Metasploitable2  
Host: 192.168.56.102

Objective: Simulate real-world exploitation and post-exploitation workflows using Metasploit, Burp Suite and sqlmap.

Tools Used:
- Metasploit
- Burp Suite
- sqlmap
- Meterpreter
- sha256sum

## Exploit Simulation Log

| Exploit ID | Description | Target IP | Status | Payload |
|----------|------------|----------|--------|---------|
| 001 | vsftpd Backdoor RCE | 192.168.56.102 | Success | Unix Reverse Shell |
| 002 | Samba RCE | 192.168.56.102 | Success | Meterpreter |
| 003 | UnrealIRCd Backdoor | 192.168.56.102 | Success | Command Shell |

## Exploit-DB Validation (50-Word Summary)

Public exploit database records confirm that Metasploitable2 contains intentionally vulnerable services such as vsftpd, Samba and UnrealIRCd. These exploits are well-documented with reliable proof-of-concept payloads that allow command execution and shell access, making the environment ideal for validating exploitation workflows and post-exploitation techniques.

## Privilege Escalation

| Technique | Tool | Result |
|---------|----|------|
| NFS Misconfiguration Abuse | Metasploit | Root Access |
| Weak Service Permissions | Meterpreter | Elevated Privileges |

---

## Evidence Collection

| Item | Description | Collected By | Date | Hash Value |
|----|------------|------------|------|-----------|
| System Config | /etc/passwd | VAPT Analyst | 2026-01-02 | e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb924 |

Hash Command Used:
sha256sum /etc/passwd

---

## Conclusion

The exploitation and post-exploitation phases confirmed that multiple vulnerable services allow unauthorized access, privilege escalation and evidence collection. These workflows simulate real-world pentest operations and demonstrate complete attack lifecycle understanding.
