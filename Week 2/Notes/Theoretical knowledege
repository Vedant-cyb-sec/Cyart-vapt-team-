 
1.Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is the process of finding security weaknesses in systems and websites using automated tools.

•	Types of Scans
Scan	Purpose	Tool
Network Scan	Finds open ports & services	Nmap
Web/App Scan	Finds web vulnerabilities	Nikto
Unauthenticated	External attacker view	–
Authenticated	Deep internal scan	–


•	CVSS Scoring

CVSS measures severity from 0 to 10.
Score	-	Risk
0–3.9	 -     Low
4–6.9	 -     Medium
7–8.9	 -     High
9–10    	 -     Critical
	
Example: Apache Struts RCE = Critical (CVSS 10)

-	False Positives
False positives are incorrect scan results and must be manually verified.

2. Penetration Testing
Penetration testing is an authorized security testing process to find real exploitable vulnerabilities.
-	Pentest Phases (PTES)
Phase	Meaning
Recon	Information gathering
Scanning	Finding vulnerabilities
Exploitation	Attacking the weakness
Post-Exploitation	Collecting proof
Reporting	Writing report
Pentesting must always be legal and within scope.

3. Exploit Basics

Vulnerability  	Meaning
SQL Injection   -	Database attack
XSS                   - 	Script injection
Buffer Overflow -	 Memory attack
	
-	Mitigations

Protection	 Purpose
ASLR      -	 Blocks memory attacks
WAF       -	 Blocks bad requests
Patching -	 Fixes bugs
