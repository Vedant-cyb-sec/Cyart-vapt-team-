## Exploitation Workflow
1. Reconnaissance

The target machine was scanned using Nmap to identify open ports, running services, and potential attack vectors. Web services were mapped to locate vulnerable endpoints and plugin versions.

2. Vulnerability Identification

Application endpoints were tested using Burp Suite to confirm injection points, reflected input, and misconfigured WordPress plugins that could lead to chained exploitation.

3. Initial Access

A cross‑site scripting (XSS) vector was used to gain session access, which was chained with a known vulnerable plugin to achieve remote code execution through Metasploit.

4. Payload Execution

A Meterpreter reverse shell was deployed to gain an interactive session on the target host.

5. Post‑Exploitation

System enumeration was performed to confirm access level, explore sensitive files, and validate persistence feasibility.

6. Exploit Customization

Public PoC scripts were modified in Python to improve exploit stability, payload delivery, and execution success rate.

7. Defense Bypass

Return Oriented Programming techniques were applied using Ghidra to bypass ASLR protections in a vulnerable local binary.

8. Reporting

All findings, exploit steps, impact analysis, and remediation guidance were compiled into a professional vulnerability report.
