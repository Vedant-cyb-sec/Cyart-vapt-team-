##API Security Testing Workflow
1. API Endpoint Enumeration

API endpoints were enumerated using Postman and Burp Suite by observing application traffic and documenting available routes, parameters, and authentication requirements.

2. Authorization Validation (BOLA Testing)

Object-level authorization controls were tested by observing API behavior when requesting both authorized and unauthorized objects. Responses were compared against expected secure behavior to identify Broken Object Level Authorization weaknesses.

3. Token Handling & Session Validation

Authorization tokens were intercepted and modified using Burp Suite Repeater to evaluate improper access control, token reuse, and privilege boundary enforcement.

4. GraphQL Injection & Input Validation Testing

GraphQL endpoints were tested using crafted queries in Postman to analyze backend query handling, field exposure, and input validation controls.

5. Injection Confirmation

sqlmap was used to confirm suspected injection points and validate manual findings under controlled lab conditions.

6. Rate Limiting & Abuse Checks

Repeated API requests were generated to observe rate-limiting enforcement and potential abuse risks.

7. Documentation & Reporting

All findings were documented with expected vs observed behavior, impact analysis, and remediation guidance following OWASP API Top-10 standards.
