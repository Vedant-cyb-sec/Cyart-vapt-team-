1. Advanced Exploitation Lab

This lab focuses on hands‑on exploitation, multi‑stage attack chaining, and real‑world bypass techniques using industry‑standard offensive security tooling. The objective is to simulate realistic attack paths, understand exploit development, and practice defense evasion in a controlled environment.

Lab Objectives

Perform chained exploitation against vulnerable web applications

Develop and customize Proof‑of‑Concept (PoC) exploits

Bypass modern binary exploitation mitigations

Document findings using professional vulnerability reporting standards

 Exploit Chain Simulation

A multi‑stage exploit chain was executed against a vulnerable WordPress‑based VulnHub machine to demonstrate real‑world attacker workflow — from initial injection to full system compromise.

Exploit ID	Description	Target IP	Status	Payload
007	XSS → RCE Chain	192.168.1.100	Success	Meterpreter
