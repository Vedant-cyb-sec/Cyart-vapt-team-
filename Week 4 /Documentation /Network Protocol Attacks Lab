##Network Protocol Attacks Lab

Overview

This lab focuses on understanding and exploiting weaknesses in common network protocols through Man‑in‑the‑Middle (MitM) techniques. The objective is to simulate real‑world internal network attacks, capture authentication material, and analyze intercepted traffic using standard offensive security tools.

Tools Used

Responder – LLMNR/NBT‑NS poisoning and NTLM hash capture

Ettercap – ARP spoofing and MitM attack execution

Wireshark – Network traffic capture and analysis

Tasks Performed
1. SMB Relay / NTLM Capture

Responder was configured to listen for LLMNR and NBT‑NS requests on the network. An SMB authentication attempt was triggered from the target system, resulting in successful interception of NTLM credentials.

Attack Log:

Attack ID	Technique	Target IP	Status	Outcome
015	SMB Relay	192.168.1.200	Success	NTLM Hash
2. Man‑in‑the‑Middle Attack (ARP Spoofing)

Ettercap was used to perform ARP spoofing between the victim and the gateway, allowing interception of network traffic. Captured packets were analyzed to observe plaintext data, authentication attempts, and protocol behavior.



Key Findings

LLMNR/NBT‑NS poisoning can lead to credential leakage in misconfigured networks

SMB authentication attempts expose NTLM hashes when intercepted

ARP spoofing enables full traffic interception on unsecured LANs
