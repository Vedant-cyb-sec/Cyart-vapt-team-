Privilege Escalation and Persistence Lab

Objective: Demonstrate the ability to escalate privileges and establish persistence on a vulnerable system.

Tools:

Metasploit (Meterpreter, Exploit modules)
LinPEAS (Linux Privilege Escalation Awesome Script)
PowerSploit (PowerShell-based offensive tools)
Tasks:

1.Privilege Escalation
Use LinPEAS to enumerate SUID vulnerabilities on a VulnHub VM.
Exploit identified vulnerabilities to escalate privileges and obtain a root shell.
Document each step thoroughly, including tool usage, command output, and results.
Task ID	Technique	Target IP	Status	Outcome
010	SUID Exploit	192.168.1.150	Success	Root Shell

2.Persistence
Choose one of the following persistence methods to set up on the vulnerable system: a. Cron Job: Create a cron job to ensure the attacker's foothold endures after reboots. Use a cleverly named script to avoid detection. b. System Service: Modify a system service to include the attacker's payload, ensuring it runs at system startup.
Document the chosen persistence method, including step-by-step instructions and any considerations for evading detection.

Enhanced Tasks:

User-Defined SUID: Write a simple C program that sets the SUID bit and provides a basic shell. Compile and run the program on the vulnerable VM, then use LinPEAS to identify it as an enumeration target.
Sudo Bypasses: Explore ways to bypass the sudo password requirement using known exploits, local vulnerabilities, or environment variables. Document successful techniques.
Log Cleanup: Implement techniques to remove evidence of persistence methods from log files, such as /var/log/syslog or /var/log/apt.
