## Mobile Application Testing Lab – Documentation Content

# Objective

To analyze an Android application for security vulnerabilities using static and dynamic analysis tools, and document the findings following a structured mobile pentesting workflow.

# Static Analysis (MobSF)

Tool Used: Mobile Security Framework (MobSF)
Target: test.apk

Description:
The APK was uploaded to MobSF to identify insecure configurations, exposed data, and storage issues. MobSF automatically analyzed the manifest, source code, permissions, and local storage usage.

Finding Log
Test ID 	Vulnerability	    Severity	Target App
016     	Insecure Storage	High	    test.apk

Observation:
Sensitive data was stored in plaintext within the app’s local storage, making it accessible to attackers on rooted devices or through backup extraction.

IPC Testing (Drozer)

Tool Used: Drozer
Purpose: Identify exposed Android components.

Description:
Drozer was used to enumerate exported activities, services, and content providers. Improperly exposed IPC components were tested to check if unauthorized access or data leakage was possible without required permissions.
